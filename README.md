###  Extracurriculars & Interests

Beyond the classroom, I'm involved in a few other things:

* **Senior Representative, IEEE (Tufts Chapter):** I represent the senior class to help plan and organize professional development events, workshops, and networking opportunities for engineering students.
* **Member, Tufts Robotics Club:** I am an active member of the Pac-Bot team, where we design, build, and program an autonomous robot to compete in a Pac-Man-themed environment.
* **Hobbies:** When I'm not coding or building, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons, practicing the guitar, and designing and 3D printing custom parts.
