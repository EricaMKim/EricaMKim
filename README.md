###  extracurriculars & Interests

Beyond the classroom, I'm involved in a few other things:

* **Member, Tufts Robotics Club:** Collaborating with other students to build and compete in the upcoming PacBot competition at MIT.
* **Volunteer, Society of Women Engineers (SWE):** Participating in outreach events to encourage young women to pursue STEM fields.
* **Hobbies:** When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking in the Fells, 3D printing custom parts, and reading science fiction.
